                    <h1>I'm Ashton, the face behind spysat.</h1>
                    <p>I am currently studying at Seneca College, and in my spare time I work on open-source projects to teach myself extracurricular skills. Below are just a few of the projects I am unfortunately responsible for.</p>
                    <div id="projects">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Kimochi</h3>
                                <p>My current work-in-progress. A spiritual successor project to Pomf using TypeScript frameworks to deliver a modern, fast and self-documenting open source file hosting solution. Initial progress has been slow due to school taking up the majority of my time, but I estimate the project will be complete by Q3 2024.                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Simple Hammers</h3>
                                <p>
                                    While looking for Minecraft mods, I noticed nobody had written a hammers mod for the game and modloader version that I was using, so I wrote my own. Through this, I was able to learn Java from scratch. This was initially developed as a fork of an existing, older hammers mod, but turned into a full rewrite. Through developing this mod, I was able to contribute code upstream to port the base mod to a newer version, and I reduced the code complexity of my own mod significantly by using the original mod libraries over the custom solution my project was based upon.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>PleaseHireMeBot</h3>
                                <p>While I am already familiar with Python, I was not familiar with the Discord API. I managed to re-implement some basic GNU command-line tools and add typical Discord bot functionality. 
                                    I was also able to get to grips with web scraping technologies to add a simple character.ai hook to the bot, allowing users to chat with character.ai models without leaving the Discord app.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
