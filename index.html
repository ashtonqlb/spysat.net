                <h2><i>I'm Ashton, I develop "software".</i></h2>
                <p> I studied Computer Programming & Analysis at Seneca Polytechnic from 2022 to 2024, and I am
                    currently in-between jobs at the moment.
                    I am proficient in JavaScript and I am currently learning Rust, but my real expertise is
                    administrating my home server (I run my own private search, email and Matrix instance). I can also
                    whip up an <i>excellent</i> PowerPoint.<br></br>
                    In my spare time, I like to hike, bake and play with my cats. I also work on open-source projects to
                    keep myself up-to-date with the latest and "greatest" software industry trends.
                    Below are just a few of the things I am fortunate enough to be responsible for.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="projects">
                <ul>

                        <h3><a href="https://github.com/ashtonqlb/nakai">Hostess</a></h3>
                        <p>My current work-in-progress. A spiritual successor project to Pomf using Rust to deliver a
                            modern, fast and self-documenting open source file hosting solution. Initial progress has
                            been slow due to work taking up the majority of my time, but I estimate the project will be
                            complete by EOY 2024. If you'd like to get on board, please don't hesistate to contact me!
                        </p>

                        <h3><a href="https://github.com/ashtonqlb/simplehammers">Simple Hammers</a></h3>
                        <p>
                            A Minecraft mod that I wrote to teach myself Java programming fundamentals, and also to add
                            a feature to my specifically preferred game and modloader version. Simple Hammers was
                            initially
                            developed as a fork of an existing, older project, but eventually scope-creeped into a full
                            rewrite.
                            Through developing this mod, I was able to contribute code upstream to port the libraries I
                            was using to a newer version, and I reduced code
                            complexity significantly by moving code out of my own project and into it's dependencies.
                        </p>

                        <h3><a href="https://github.com/ashtonqlb/PleaseHireMeBot">PleaseHireMeBot</a></h3>
                        <p>I am already familiar with Python, I was not familiar with the Discord API. I managed to
                            re-implement some basic GNU command-line tools and add typical Discord bot functionality.
                            I was also able to get to grips with web scraping technologies to add a simple character.ai
                            hook to the bot, allowing users to chat with character.ai models without leaving the Discord
                            app.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>And the rest...</h3>
                        <p>My time at Seneca Polytechnic has also borne fruit. All my past schoolwork is available on my
                            GitHub so that future students may learn from my own example code. I have <a
